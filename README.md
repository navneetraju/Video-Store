Install pip dependenices using:
```
pip install -r pip_reqs.txt
```

- Each functionality is to be written in seperate python modules
- Each module has to be included in main.py
- main.py will be the main file used for full system and integration testing
- Update README.md and/or requirements.txt with all libraries that need to be installed. This helps all teammates to run code.
